This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: an infinite loop caused by a missing dependency in the dependency array.  The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises when the `useEffect` hook's dependency array is missing a value that changes within the effect itself, leading to continuous re-renders and an infinite loop. The solution involves adding the necessary dependencies to the array.
